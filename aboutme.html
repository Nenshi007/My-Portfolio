    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a B.Tech degree and have a strong interest in Machine Learning and Data Analysis.
      I enjoy exploring datasets, finding patterns, and building models that can make real-world predictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technical skills include Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and MySQL, which I use for data cleaning,
      analysis, and visualization. I also have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which helps me
      build simple web interfaces for my projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to become a Machine Learning Engineer and continue improving my analytical and programming
      skills by working on more data-driven projects.
